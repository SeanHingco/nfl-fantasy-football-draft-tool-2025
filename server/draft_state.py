draft_state.py
==============

This module defines the ``DraftState`` class, which encapsulates the
current state of a fantasy football draft.  It keeps track of the
available players, team rosters, draft order, and pick progression.  A
``DraftState`` instance can be updated as real picks occur and later
passed into a Monte Carlo simulator to generate recommendations based on
what remains on the board.

The class does **not** implement the Monte Carlo logic itselfâ€”that
functionality will live in a separate simulator.  Instead, it focuses on
maintaining and updating the state consistently as picks are made.

Usage
-----

```python
from data_loader import load_players_as_objects
from draft_models import TeamRoster
from draft_state import DraftState
from draft_utils import calculate_rounds

# Load players and initialise the draft state
players = load_players_as_objects(data_dir)
starter_req = {"QB": 1, "RB": 2, "WR": 2, "TE": 1, "FLEX": 1, "DST": 1, "K": 1}
bench = 7
n_teams = 10
user_team = 3  # The user drafts from team index 3

draft_state = DraftState(players, starter_req, bench, n_teams, user_team)

# Make a pick (e.g., remove a drafted player)
draft_state.make_pick(team_index=1, player=some_player)

# Advance to the next pick
draft_state.advance_pick()
```

        Total number of teams in the league.
    user_team_index : int
        The index of the user's team (0-based).  Used later when computing
